## Method

### 1. Make the coulis
Put the raspberries and sugar into a small saucepan.  
Bring to a simmer and crush the fruit with the back of a fork.  
Bubble for **2 minutes**, then remove from the heat and press through a sieve into a bowl, discarding the pips.  
Set aside to cool.

### 2. Make the cheesecake filling
Heat the cream in a large pan until just below boiling point.  
Remove from the heat, add the white chocolate, and leave for **5 minutes**, then stir until smooth.

In a large bowl, use a wooden spoon to beat together the soft cheese, yogurt, and vanilla until combined.  
Use a balloon whisk to gradually incorporate the chocolate mixture until smooth, thickened, and glossy.  
Set aside.

### 3. Prepare the biscuit base
Put the melted butter, digestive biscuits, hazelnuts, and **4 Puds Minis** into a food processor.  
Pulse to a rough crumb.

Divide the mixture between **6 glasses or shallow glass bowls**.  
Spoon over the cheesecake mixture, then swirl through some raspberry coulis.  
Finish with the remaining Puds Minis, halved.

Chill for **2–24 hours** before serving.

## Cook’s Tip
**Roasted chopped hazelnuts** are great for using up leftovers.
