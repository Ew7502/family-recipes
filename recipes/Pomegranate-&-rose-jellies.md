## Method

### 1.
Put the gelatine sheets in a bowl of cold water and set aside to soak.  
Put most of the pomegranate seeds into a food processor (reserving some to decorate) with 300ml water and the caster sugar, then whizz to a pulpy juice.  
Pour through a fine sieve into a large jug or bowl and discard the solids.

While the pomegranate juice is straining, pour the apple juice into a medium pan and warm through over a medium heat until hot but not boiling, then remove from the heat.

### 2.
Squeeze the excess water out of the gelatine sheets, then whisk into the hot apple juice until completely dissolved.  
Whisk in the strained pomegranate juice, rose water, and a pinch of salt until combined.

Divide between **6 small glasses** (about 150ml each).  
Leave to cool, then refrigerate for **at least 3 hours** to set.

When ready to serve, lightly whip the cream until just holding soft peaks.  
Dollop on top of the jellies and sprinkle over the reserved pomegranate seeds.

## 🌹 Cook’s Tip
**Rose water** is powerful stuff — add a few drops at a time.  
It works beautifully in desserts, but also in lamb stews, rice dishes, shortbread, ice cream, cocktails, and fruit salads.
