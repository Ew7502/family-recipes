## Method

### 1. Prepare the night before
Put **125g raspberries** and **125g blueberries** into a small saucepan with the sugar (or maple syrup).  
Bring to a gentle simmer and cook for **3–4 minutes**, until the fruit softens slightly.  
Leave to cool, then transfer to a sealable container and chill overnight.

In a separate sealable container, mix together the oats, oat drink, non-dairy yogurt, cinnamon, and chia seeds.  
Stir well, cover, and chill overnight.

### 2. Assemble in the morning
Layer alternating spoonfuls of the oats and berry compote into **two glasses or jars**.  
If the oats are very thick, loosen with a splash of extra oat drink.  
Sprinkle over some toasted almonds as you layer.

Top with the **reserved berries** and a final sprinkle of almonds before serving.

## Cook’s Tip
Chia seeds are a great source of fibre and omega-3 fatty acids.  
They’re great stirred into porridge or blended into breakfast smoothies.
