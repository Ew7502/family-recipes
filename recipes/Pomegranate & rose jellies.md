    <h3>1.</h3>
    <p>
      Put the gelatine sheets in a bowl of cold water and set aside to soak.  
      Put most of the pomegranate seeds into a food processor (reserving some to decorate) with 300ml water and the caster sugar, then whizz to a pulpy juice.  
      Pour through a fine sieve into a large jug or bowl and discard the solids.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the pomegranate juice is straining, pour the apple juice into a medium pan and warm through over a medium heat until hot but not boiling, then remove from the heat.
    </p>

    <h3>2.</h3>
    <p>
      Squeeze the excess water out of the gelatine sheets, then whisk into the hot apple juice until completely dissolved.  
      Whisk in the strained pomegranate juice, rose water, and a pinch of salt until combined.
    </p>
    <p>
      Divide the mixture between <strong>6 small glasses</strong> (about 150ml each).  
      Leave to cool, then transfer to the fridge for at least <strong>3 hours</strong> to set completely.
    </p>

    <p>
      When ready to serve, lightly whip the cream until just holding soft peaks.  
      Dollop on top of the jellies and sprinkle over the reserved pomegranate seeds.

    <h2>Cook’s Tip</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Rose water:</strong> A little goes a long way. Add gradually so it doesn’t overpower the dish.  
      It’s surprisingly versatile — great in lamb stews, baked rice, shortbread, ice cream, cocktails, and fruit salads.
