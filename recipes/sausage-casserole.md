## Method:

Slice the onions and carrots. Heat the oil in a flameproof casserole.  
Add the sausages and fry until evenly browned, about 5 minutes.  
Remove from the casserole and cut each sausage into 2 or 3 pieces.

### 2.  
Lower the heat and add the onions and carrots to the casserole.  
Cook, stirring, until beginning to soften.

### 3.  
Return the sausages to the casserole.  
Drain and rinse the chickpeas and kidney beans, then add them to the casserole along with the tomatoes.  
Blend the cornflour with a little of the stock, then add it to the casserole with the remaining stock, Tabasco, tomato pur√©e, and seasoning. Stir well.

### 4.  
Bring to the boil, then cover and cook at **170¬∞C (325¬∞F), Gas Mark 3** for about **1 hour**, or longer if possible, to deepen the flavour.  
Sprinkle with chopped parsley and garnish with sage sprigs.  
Serve with lots of crusty bread to soak up the juices!
