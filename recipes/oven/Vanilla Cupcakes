## Method

### Step 1
Heat oven to 180°C (160°C fan) / gas 4. Line a 12-hole cupcake tray with paper cases.

### Step 2
Using an electric whisk, beat the butter and sugar together until pale and fluffy. Whisk in the eggs, one at a time, scraping down the sides of the bowl after each addition.

### Step 3
Add the vanilla extract, self-raising flour, and a pinch of salt. Whisk until just combined, then spoon the mixture into the cupcake cases.

### Step 4
Bake for 15 minutes until golden brown and a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean. Leave to cool completely on a wire rack.

### Step 5
To make the buttercream, whisk the butter until super soft. Add the icing sugar, vanilla extract, and a pinch of salt.

### Step 6
Whisk together until smooth (start slowly to avoid a cloud of icing sugar), then beat in the milk.

### Step 7
If using, stir in your food colouring. Spoon or pipe the buttercream onto the cooled cupcakes.
