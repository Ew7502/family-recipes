## 👩‍🍳 Instructions

### 1. Prepare the Filling

1. In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the cubed steak and sear on all sides until browned. Remove the steak from the pan and set aside.  
2. In the same pan, add the chopped onions and cook for about 5 minutes until softened.  
3. Add the minced garlic and sliced mushrooms, and cook for an additional 3–4 minutes until the mushrooms are soft and browned.  
4. Sprinkle in the flour and cook for 1–2 minutes, stirring constantly to form a roux (this will help thicken the sauce).  
5. Slowly pour in the beef stock, stirring constantly to avoid lumps. Add Worcestershire sauce, thyme, and bay leaves. Stir to combine.  
6. Return the steak to the pan, bring to a simmer, and cook for about 45 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the meat is tender and the sauce has thickened. Season with salt and pepper to taste.  
7. Remove bay leaves before adding the filling to the pie dish.

### 2. Assemble the Pie

1. Preheat oven to 180°C (350°F).  
2. Roll out the puff pastry on a floured surface to fit the pie dish, leaving 2–3 cm extra for overlap.  
3. Spoon in the filling, spreading it evenly.  
4. Cover with the rolled-out pastry, press to seal, and trim excess (leave ~1cm overhang).  
5. Cut a few slits in the pastry to let steam escape.  
6. Brush the top with beaten egg for a golden finish.

### 3. Bake

1. Place the pie on a baking tray.  
2. Bake for 30–35 minutes until the pastry is golden, puffed, and crispy.  
3. Let cool for a few minutes before serving.

## 💡 Tips

- For a richer flavor, add a splash of balsamic vinegar or soy sauce to the filling.
- Add caramelized onions or frozen peas for a heartier version.
- If pastry edges brown too fast, cover them with foil during baking.
