## Method

### 1.
Put the blueberries and elderflower cordial into a small saucepan.  
Heat gently, shaking the pan occasionally, until the berries release their juices and are coated in a light syrup, about **3–4 minutes**.

Divide the mixture between **6 glasses or ramekins** (about 175ml each) and chill while you prepare the lemon cream.

### 2.
Rinse out the pan, then add the sugar, cream, and lemon zest.  
Set over a medium heat and stir to combine. Bring to the boil, then simmer for a couple of minutes.

Remove from the heat and stir in the lemon juice and yogurt until smooth and combined.  
Pour through a sieve into a jug, then carefully pour over the blueberry compote in the glasses.

Chill for at least **6 hours**, or overnight, until fully set.

### 3.
Just before serving, lightly crush the amaretti biscuits and sprinkle over the tops of the pots.
